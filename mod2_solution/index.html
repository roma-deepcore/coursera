            <div class="course__description">There is a farm near the Enchanted Forest, and on that farm lived a cat, a dog, a herd of pigs, a flock of sheep, and a whole mess of chickens. They were happy and content, and did not the bother the other, and lived in harmony, in general. They grew vegetables in the garden, and made different jams and pickles to live on, by selling the surplus of thing to tourists who knew no better.</div>

            <div class="course__description">The corridors are dimly lit, there's plenty of rubbish strewn about and suspicious looking stains adorn the walls. Could be blood, could be paan, didn't matter. It wasn't the kind of place you'd go to if you didn't know where it led. I knew where I was headed and eventually you got used to these sort of things growing up in Bombay. The real heroes needed me and a little dirt along the way ain't no trouble.</div>

            <div class="course__description">I used to think that Red Bull was the most destructive invention of the past 50 years. I was wrong. Red Bull has been usurped by the portable alcohol breathalyzer. The same device that cops have been using for 10 years to conduct field sobriety tests is now offered by the Sharper Image for $99. It is the size and shape of a small cell phone with a clear round tube sticking up from the top, almost like an antenna.
